    Click on an empty location to create a new state.
    <br>
    Click on a state to edit whether it's an accept state, a reject state, or neither.
    <br>
    Drag and drop from one state to another to add a transition.
    <br>
    Click a transition arrow to edit the transition symbols and the action of each symbol
    <br>
    Right click a state and then left click on an empty location to move the state to that location.
    <br>
    Curved arrows are obnoxious, so mutually connected states are not permitted
    <br>
    - (ie if there's a transition from state A to state B, there cannot be a transition from B to A.
     Use an intermediate state with an &epsilon; transition to B to simulate one)
    <br>
    <br>
    TODO (for editor): transition click detection, state and transition editors, saving/loading
    machines, and undo/redo buttons, and relocating states.
    <br>
    After the editor, implementing running machines on input should barely require thought.
